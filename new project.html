<h1>LIST OF COURSES</h1>
<h2>CORE</h2>
<ol>
    <li style="font-style: italic;">Discrete Mathematics - Discrete Mathematics is a branch of mathematics involving
        discrete elements that uses algebra and arithmetic.
        It is increasingly being applied in the practical fields of mathematics and computer science.
        It is a very good tool for improving reasoning and problem-solving capabilities.</li> <br>
    <li style="font-style: italic;">Principles of Programming Languages - Understand the concepts and terms used to
        describe languages that support the imperative, functional, object-oriented, and logic programming patterns.
        Solve problems using the functional patterns, object-oriented patterns and logic programming patterns.</li> <br>
    <li style="font-style: italic;">Introduction to Algorithms - This subject explains the use of algorithms, or
        step-by-step sets of instructions, to complete a task and problem-solving. It helps students and programmers
        throughout their career in Computer science. </li> <br>
    <li style="font-style: italic;">Hardware Design - Hardware design create and design computer hardware
        components, including circuit boards, microchips, and scanners. This subject gives knowledge to draft different
        designs and make prototypes to test for accuracy and other factors.</li> <br>
    <li style="font-style: italic;">Operating Systems - The main objective of OS is to hide the details of the hardware
        resources from the users. ... To keep track of who is using which resource, granting resource requests, and
        mediating conflicting requests from different programs and users. To provide efficient and fair sharing of
        resources among users and programs.</li> <br>
    <li style="font-style:italic;">Computer Networking - Resource sharing is the main objective of the computer network.
        The goal is to provide all the program, data and hardware available to everyone on the network without regard
        to the physical location of the resource and the users and also to provide the high
        Reliability for users. </li> <br>
    <li style="font-style: italic;">Graphics Programming - Transform information into creative, conceptually appropriate
        design solutions using industry-standard production software and hardware. keep a goal of Developing a personal,
        research-baseddesign process that applies graphic design theory in the creation of aesthetically pleasing
        artifacts. It plays one ofthe major role in Computer science.</li> <br>
    <li style="font-style: italic;">AI and Machine Learning - The basic objective of AI (also called heuristic
        programming, machine intelligence, or the simulation of cognitive behavior) is to enable computers to perform
        such intellectual tasks as decision making, problem solving, perception, understanding human communication (in
        any language, and translate among them)etc. Today, the amount of data that is generated, by both humans and
        machines, far outpaces humans' ability to absorb, interpret, and make complex decisions based on that data.
        Artificial intelligence forms the basis for all computer learning and is the future of all complex decision
        making. </li> <br>
